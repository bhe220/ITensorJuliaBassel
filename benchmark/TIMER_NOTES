# Mappings:

prod_t (Davidson A*v time) = 21

contract_t (all contractions at low level) = 30
gemm_t = 31
permute_t = 32

svd_t = 40

--------------

# Summary (from DMRG timings):

In C++, permute_t only half of gemm_t. In Julia they are about equal.

GEMM time is twice as much in Julia as in C++ !
